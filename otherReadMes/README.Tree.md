# Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
***
## Challenge
* Java: a package named tree which contains a file called Tree.java
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the left and right children.
* Create a BinaryTree class
    * Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
* Create a BinarySearchTree class
    * Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
    * Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
***
## API
* BinaryTree
    * preOrder()
    * inOrder()
    * postOrder()
* BinarySearchTree
    * add() - accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
    * contains() - accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
