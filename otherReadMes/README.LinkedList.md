## Java401 CC - LinkedList

* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.
* Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
* Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
* Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and returns a collection all of the current Node values in the Linked List.
***
* Add a method named .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* Add a method named .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
* Add a method named .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node

## Approach

Time: O(1);
Space: O(n);
