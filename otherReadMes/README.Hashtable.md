## Java401 CC - Hash Table
* Implement a hash table data structure with the following methods-
***
* add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
***
* get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
***
* contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
***
* hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
***
## Approach

Time: O(1);

Space: O(n);
