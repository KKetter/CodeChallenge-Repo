# FizzBuzz Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
***
## Challenge
* Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
* Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes

    * If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
    * If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    * If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
* Return the tree with its values
* For explicitly-typed languages: Ensure your node values are of type Object, to hold either strings or integers.

## API

* fizzBuzzTree()
    * If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
    * If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    * If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
    * Return the tree with its values
